            <h2>About me</h3>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my homepage. Here you can see a portfolio of my skills, and some projects I have worked on.</p>
            <p>My main interests are game development, programming, and music production. I have used Unity, GameMaker and Godot to make a few games you can see at <a href="http://enducube.itch.io/">enducube.itch.io</a>.</p>
            <p>I am currently in my second year studying at the University of Canterbury, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Game development. My skills so far include programming in Python, C#, Java, and GDScript, and composition of game music.</p>

            <h2>VR Projects from 2024 (PROD223)</h3>
            <p>In Semester 1 of 2024, I made two VR projects using Unity and the XR Interaction System.</p>
            <p><strong>The Mirrorverse Experiment</strong> is a very short puzzle game where you are able to interact with objects both in your world and in the mirror world.</p>

            <br>
            <p>I also made a <strong>Beat Saber Clone</strong> during PROD223 where players can select from multiple songs, and slice cubes to the beat. I do not have a video, but I have some screenshots.</p>
